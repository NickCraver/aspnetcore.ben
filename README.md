        Dear contributor,
        
        Once upon a time I had a dream. A dream of the perfect framework that helps you get your job done
        better, faster, more realiably.

        During my quest, I realized that my way of thinking is wrong. It's not about the framework. It's
        not about how sexy your code reads. It's about finding your way. And the best way to find your
        way is by writing your own framework. Use this template to start your effort. Once you're done,
        your framework should become the same as this template: empty.

        This comment shall remain for the truly interested. The people willing to look behind the curtain,
        the people willing to dig deep, the people willing to delete code to reach the nirvana of programming.
        
        May the code work for you.

Faster things, not for use in production
